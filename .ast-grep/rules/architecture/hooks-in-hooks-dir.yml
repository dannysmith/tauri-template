message: |
  React hooks (functions starting with 'use') must be in hooks/ or services/, not lib/.

  BAD: lib/some-file.ts exporting useSomething()
  GOOD: hooks/use-something.ts or services/something.ts

  The lib/ directory is for pure business logic and utilities.
severity: error
language: TypeScript
files:
  - 'src/lib/**/*.ts'
  - 'src/lib/**/*.tsx'
rule:
  pattern: export function use$NAME($$$PARAMS) { $$$BODY }
note: |
  Enforces directory boundaries:
  - lib/: Pure business logic, utilities (no React hooks)
  - hooks/: React hooks
  - services/: TanStack Query hooks for data fetching

  Exception: Theme context provider can live in lib/.
